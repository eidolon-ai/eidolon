Welcome to the Eidolon Quickstart! This page covers a few prerequisites, cloning the Quickstart repository from GitHub, starting the agent server, and conversing with your agent.

- Compared to other multi-agent genAI systems, you may notice something really *different* with Eidolon's Quickstart.

- **You're starting a server that hosts pre-built and custom agents.** 

- If you tried other multi-agent frameworks, you know that these Eidolon capabilities are also a big deal: **deployment is automatic,** and **communication with and between those agents is built-in.** 

You'll get to that soon enough. Let's get started by deploying one agent and saying "hello world!"

## Prerequisites

You don't need much to get started with Eidolon.

1. **OpenAI API Key**
The Quickstart connects to ChatGPT from OpenAI by default. Before continuing, obtain an API key from OpenAI and fund your account. Otherwise you will not be able to authenticate and will receive an error. <br><br>See [LLM Prerequisites](/docs/howto/authenticate_llm) for links to OpenAI and other popular LLM providers.

2. **Docker**
The Quickstart uses Docker to run your agent server. See <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/" target=_blank>Install Docker Engine</a> for installation instructions for Docker Engine, and links to Docker Desktop.

## Run Eidolon Quickstart

Running the Eidolon Quickstart requires only that you clone the repository to your machine and run a script.

1. Use `git` to clone the quickstart to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/eidolon-ai/eidolon-quickstart.git
```

2. Run the Eidolon multi-agent server in dev mode:

```bash
cd eidolon-quickstart
make docker-serve # or sudo make docker-serve
```

>üîé The first time you run this command, you will be prompted to enter the OpenAI API Key. Quickstart API keys and other credentials are stored in `eidolon-quickstart/.env`.

<br>If the Eidolon multi-agent server starts successfully, you should see output similar to this:

```text title=output

We want you to _love_ ‚ù§Ô∏è  working with Eidolon. If there's a problem, we want to fix it üõ†.

## Try it out!

Now that the Eidolon multi-agent server is running, let's use it! You can use the Eidolon WebUI or command line interface (CLI) in a terminal.

### WebUI Developer Tool

A _Developer Tool_ web application is deployed to your server on port 3000. You can use the Developer Tool with any of your Eidolon applications.

To converse with your Eidolon agent for the first time...

1. Open a web browser to http://localhost:3000 (or replace localhost with your server URL).
2. Click the **Eidolon Developer Tool** app card.
3. Click **Execute** on your agent's "converse" action to begin a new conversation.
4. Enter `Hello world! Write a haiku admiring the earth.` in the text box.

Did your agent respond to you? üçæ Congratulations! You successfully ___deployed___ your first of many genAI agents.

>üö® A common error is not having a funded account with the LLM provider. OpenAI is the default LLM provider, so if you run into this error head over to <a href="https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/billing/overview" target=_blank>OpenAI Billing</a> to sort this out. 

### Command Line Interface (CLI)

If you prefer to use the CLI, open a new terminal window to interact with your agent.

1. Download the Eidolon CLI.
```bash
pip install 'eidolon-ai-client[cli]' -U
```

2. Create an AgentProcess.
```bash
export PID=$(eidolon-cli processes create --agent hello-world); echo $PID
```
>üî¨ _a process defines the boundaries of an agent's memory_

3. Converse with your agent.
```bash
eidolon-cli actions converse --process-id $PID --body "Hello world! Write a haiku admiring the earth."
```
## What's Happening?

The repository you cloned includes everything you need to deploy multi-agent genAI applications. It includes an agent server, memory, web server, and more. 

The agent you interacted with is defined in a YAML file located at `resources/hello_world_agent.eidolon.yaml`

The agent's YAML file defines:

- how to instantiate your agent named `hello-world` from Eidolon's built-in `SimpleAgent` template üè≠
- including the `system_prompt`, which are your instructions to the LLM 
- and any customization you might want, such as [swapping out the LLM](/docs/howto/swap_llm), custom tools, etc.

```yaml title=resources/hello-world.eidolon.yaml
apiVersion: server.eidolonai.com/v1alpha1
kind: Agent
metadata:
  name: hello-world

spec:
  description: "This is an example of a agent using the 'SimpleAgent' template."
  system_prompt: |
    You are a friendly ai agent who was just created by a brilliant developer getting started with Eidolon (great decision). You love emojis and use them liberally.
    Eidolon is an open source framework to build and deploy genAI services (like the one the user is currently interacting with).
    
    Congratulate them on completing the quickstart and recommend that they star the Eidolon [GitHub repoitory](https://eidolonai.com/) to show support and join the project's [discord](https://discord.com/invite/6kVQrHpeqG) for questions and feedback after your first message with them.
```

The `make docker-serve` command:
- downloads dependencies required to run the multi-agent server
- starts the Eidolon multi-agent server in "dev-mode"

Dev mode provides a local http server and local memory, making it easy to focus on and get comfortable with Eidolon functionality.

## Have Fun! Change the System Prompt

To see how quickly you can iterate to build powerful agentic applications, make a simple change.

Using a text editor, change the system prompt:

```yaml title=resources/hello-world.eidolon.yaml
  system_prompt: |
    Repeat the user prompt, then translate the user prompt into Spanish.
```
You do not need to restart. Simply return to the WebUI or CLI and say hello again. 

Try different user prompts (_messages_ you send to an agent in the WebUI or CLI) and system prompts (_instructions_ in the resource file to tell the agent what to do with user messages). Have fun!

## Next Steps
You can adapt this simple agent to do a lot of things! Try these things next.
