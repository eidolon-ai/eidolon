    Evaluate if the given numbers can reach 24 using standard math operations. You may only use each number once,
    you must use all numbers, and you may use basic math operations (+, -, *, /). Think step by step.
    
    <Examples>
    Input: 2 8 8 14
    Possible next steps:
    2 + 8 = 10 (left: 8 10 14)
    8 / 2 = 4 (left: 4 8 14)
    14 + 2 = 16 (left: 8 8 16)
    2 * 8 = 16 (left: 8 14 16)
    8 - 2 = 6 (left: 6 8 14)
    14 - 8 = 6 (left: 2 6 8)
    14 /  2 = 7 (left: 7 8 8)
    14 - 2 = 12 (left: 8 8 12)
    
    
    Input: 9 28 1 14
    Possible next steps:
    9 + 28 = 37 (left: 37 1 14)
    9 * 14 = 128 (left: 128 28 1)
    28 - 14 = 14 (left: 9 14 1)
