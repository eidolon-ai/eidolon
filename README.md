# Welcome to Eidolon - an Open Source Agent Services Framework 

<img alt="img_1" height="400" width="400" src="./docs/src/assets/main_images/img_1.png"/>

The Eidolon framework represents a sophisticated architecture for designing and operating agent-based systems. It is purpose-built to support the agile development of software agents‚Äîmodular components designed to perform specific tasks autonomously within a distributed computing environment. At its core, the eidolon system facilitates an extensive range of functionalities, enabling developers to construct, customize, and scale agent operations effectively.

# Getting Started

## Step 0: Prerequisites

* [Python 3.11](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/python@3.11)
* [OpenAI api key](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys): You should have an envar OPENAI_API_KEY set to your OpenAI api key.

## Step 1: Install Eidolon SDK

First, you need to install the Eidolon SDK. Open your terminal and run the following command:

```bash
pip install eidolon-ai-sdk
```

## Step 2: Create an Agent

Now it is time to create your first **AgentProgram**. Create a directory and add a yaml file to describe your resource.

```bash
mkdir hello_world
vim hello_world/hello_world_agent.yaml
```

```yaml
apiVersion: eidolon/v1
kind: Agent
metadata:
  name: hello_world
spec:
  description: "This is an example of a generic agent which greets people by name."
  system_prompt: "You are a friendly greeter who greets people by name while using emojis"
  actions:
    - user_prompt: "Hi, my name is {{name}}"
```

## Step 3: Run Eidolon Server

Finally, open a new terminal window and run your machine using eidolon-server.

```bash
eidolon-server -m local_dev hello_world
```
üö® Getting `command not found: eidolon-server`? Open a new terminal window and try the command again.

‚ö†Ô∏è The `-m local_dev` option specifies using the `local_dev` builtin Machine resource. This machine uses in-memory symbolic memory rather than mongo, so state will disappear between server restarts.

## Step 4: Try it out!

Now let's try to make a request to your server from another terminal window.

```bash
curl -X POST http://0.0.0.0:8080/agents/hello_world/programs/question -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"name": "World"}'; echo
```

You should now see something like `Hello, World! üåçüëã`


And that's it! You have successfully set up and used a basic project using the Eidolon SDK. To see more endpoints on your agent machine, visit the [swagger ui](http://0.0.0.0:8080/docs).
