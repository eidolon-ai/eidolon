Instructions:
- It is helpful to follow the "user story" method, but you don't have to. 
- We prefer the [scenario-oriented "GWT" acceptance criteria](https://www.altexsoft.com/blog/acceptance-criteria-purposes-formats-and-best-practices/#h.a2wnssy5ij97) format. This helps clarify the boundaries of user acceptance testing.
- You can have more than one Acceptance Criteria per user story. E.g., one for success, and another in case there's a failure.
- Delete anything you don't use to keep the issue tidy. (Like these instructions :smile:)
