## Want to make a GPT in Eidolon?

Eidolon can do a lot of things, but sometimes the best way to learn is to start with a simple example.

In this tutorial, we'll guide you through the process of building a simple conversational agent using the Eidolon framework. This agent will be capable of understanding and responding to user inputs in a conversational manner, similar to GPTs you may be familiar with.

## Hate Writing Docs? Let an Agent Do it

Welcome to an exciting journey into the world of documentation. Sometimes you just want to focus on coding, leaving the documentation to someone—or something—else.

In this guide, we embark on creating a code search example. By the end, you'll have crafted an agent capable of writing documents and leveraging the power of RAG to sift through your project's documents and files.
