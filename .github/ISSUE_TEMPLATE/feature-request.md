It is helpful to follow the "user story" method, but you don't have to. Delete anything you don't use to keep the issue tidy. (Like these instructions :smile:)

**User Story**
- As a [persona]
- I want [to do something or have something happen automatically]
- So that [you get some sort of value, like saving time or achieving a goal]

We prefer the [scenario-oriented "Gherkin" acceptance criteria](https://www.altexsoft.com/blog/acceptance-criteria-purposes-formats-and-best-practices/#h.a2wnssy5ij97) format. This makes it clear how to build and test the feature.

**Acceptance Criteria**
- Given that [the precondition, such as using a specific feature and/or your authorization level]
- When I [do something in the product] [or when an agent does something]
- Then [desired result -- what should happen]
