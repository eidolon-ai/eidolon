This article is about a new feature we just added to Eidolon—or more specifically, added to your IDE—so you can build faster using Eidolon.

In this article, we’ll cover what this feature offers, how to enable it, and how to start using it in your project.

As a bonus, we’ll take a dive into how it works under the hood.

## What is Eidolon IDE Support? And what does it give you?
At its core, this feature is schema validation for your Eidolon resources. This means you get real-time feedback when your Eidolon resources are not correct.

This enables your IDE to offer code completion and inline documentation, speeding up development and reducing errors.

## How to enable Eidolon IDE Support
* **IntelliJ** and **PyCharm** work out of the box with Eidolon schema support.

* **Visual Studio Code** will require the [YAML plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=redhat.vscode-yaml) extension.

* **Using a different IDE?** Let us know on Discord, and we’ll add the configuration details here!

The plugins will automatically apply Eidolon’s schema to any file that ends in `.eidolon.yaml` or `.eidolon.yml`.

> Visual Studio also matches any `.yaml` file in a directory named `eidolon_resources`. __cough__ JetBrains has a bug  __cough__.

## How did we do it?
I’ll admit, I’m not exactly an IDE plugin expert, so I was a bit nervous about the difficulty. But it turns out, once you have a well-defined JSON schema, the process is surprisingly simple.

We’ve been generating JSON schema for a while now to power our docs. With the schema in hand, all we had to do was make it accessible to the IDE. [SchemaStore](https://www.schemastore.org/) is a project that both JetBrains and VS Code use as a schema library, so we just added our schema there.

They run quick tests, and my pull request was merged in just a few minutes. 10/10 dev experience, and a classic case of open-source projects helping other open-source projects.
