description: An overview of Eidolon.
---

The eidolon framework represents a sophisticated architecture for designing and operating agent-based systems. It is purpose-built to support the agile development of software agents—modular components designed to perform specific tasks autonomously
within a distributed computing environment. At its core, the eidolon system facilitates an extensive range of functionalities, enabling developers to construct, customize, and scale agent operations effectively.

This document provides a detailed description of the eidolon architecture, focusing on the core elements that constitute an agent-based infrastructure. Central to this is the **AgentMachine**, a runtime environment that executes **AgentPrograms**.
Each of these programs is driven by an **AgentCPU**.
