Welcome to the official documentation of Eidolon Agent Services, an open-source framework for designing and deploying agent-based services.

This page gives a broad overview of the framework and of this documentation, so that you know where to start if you are new to Eidolon or where to look if you need information on a specific feature.

## Before you Start

The [Quickstart Guide](/getting_started/quickstart/introduction) is a great starting point for anyone new to the Eidolon Framework. There you will find a step-by-step tutorial on setting up and running your first project with Eidolon. After that check out the video [Demos](/getting_started/demos/introduction) or text [Tutorials](/getting_started/tutorials/introduction) for inspiration and to see what is possible with Eidolon.

The [References](/references/introduction) section contains an in-depth guide showcasing the features and capabilities of Eidolon. And if you're curious about the design behind Eidolon check out the [Architecture](/architecture/introduction) section.

## Why Eidolon?
#### 1. Easy to Deploy
With Eidolon, agents are services, so there is no extra work when it comes time to deploy. The HTTP server is built in.
#### 2. Simple Agent-to-Agent Communication
Since agents are services with well-defined interfaces, they easily communicate with tools dynamically generated from the openapi json schema defined by the agent services.
#### 3. Painless Component Customization and Upgrade
With a focus on modularity, Eidolon makes it easy to swap out components. Grab an off the shelf llm, rag impl, tools, etc or just define your own.

This means no vendor lock-in and minimizes the work needed to upgrade portions of an agent. Without this flexibility, developers will not be able to adapt their agents to the rapidly changing AI landscape.
