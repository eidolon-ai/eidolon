>ðŸ‘‰ Hot tip! Some LLM providers offer evaluation credits. It's a great way to get started and save money.


## Prompts During Installations

If you are prompted to enter an API key during an installation process, it will automatically be added to the Eidolon `.env` file. 

To see your Eidolon environment settings:

```console
cd <Eidolon application root directory>
cat .env
```
## Setting New LLM API Keys

If you want to [use a new LLM](/docs/howto/swap_llm), you may need to enter an API Key to the `.env` file. See [LLM Prerequisites](#llm-prerequisites) to learn about authenticating with various providers.

Example `.env` file:

```text
OPENAI_API_KEY=youropenaiapikey
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=youranthropicapikey
MISTRAL_API_KEY=yourmistralapikey
GEMINI_API_KEY=yourgoogleapikey
```

Restart Eidolon. Agents can now authenticate with your preferred LLMs.

>Note: if the `.env` file does not exist in your application root directory, create it as a plain text file.
