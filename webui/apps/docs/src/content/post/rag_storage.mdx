In the last post we discussed what RAG is and how it works. We also showed a brief introduction to the RetrieverAgent in Eidolon and the most basic configuration of it.

In this post we will dive deeper into the storage configuration of the RetrieverAgent, the components that make up the storage pipeline and how to configure them.

## Storage Pipeline
The storage pipeline in Eidolon can be broken down into 5 main parts:
1. **Loading**: This is the first step in the pipeline. It is responsible for streaming data from the storage medium. A loader can be something simple like a file reader,
or something more complex like a GitHub repository reader.
1. **Parsing**: This is the second step in the pipeline. It is responsible for parsing the data that was loaded into text or image data. As of this writing, Eidolon supports the following parsers:
    - AutoParser: A parser that is used to automatically detect the type of data and use the appropriate parser for it.
    - TextParsers: Parsers that are used to parse text data like raw text, json, xml, etc...
    - PDFParser: A parser that is used to parse PDF files into text data.
    - CodeParsers: Parsers that are used to parse code files into text data. In particular, these are used to split code files into semantic chunks that make sense for the language.
    - HTMLParser: A parser that is used to parse HTML files into text data. We use BeautifulSoup for this.
1. **Splitting**: This is the third step in the pipeline. It is responsible for splitting the parsed data into smaller chunks. This is useful for large documents 
that are too big to be processed in one go. As of this writing, Eidolon supports the following splitters:
    - SentenceSplitter: A splitter that is used to split text data into sentences.
    - RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter: A splitter that is used to split text data into characters recursively. It optimizes for the longest possible chunks that fit into a region
   and are split by section, paragraph, sentence, or word, in that order.
    - CodeSplitter: A splitter that is used to split code data into semantic chunks.
    - HTMLSplitter: A splitter that is used to split HTML data into text data on semantic boundaries.
    - MarkdownSplitter: A splitter that is used to split markdown data into text data on semantic boundaries.
1. **Storage**: This is the final step in the pipeline. It is responsible for storing the split data in memory. It does this by adding each split first to SemanticMemory
and then to the SimilarityMemory defined on the machine.
1. **Monitoring**: This is an optional step in the pipeline. It is responsible for monitoring the loader and automatically reloading the data if it changes, deleting
chunks that are no longer present, and adding new files.

## RetrieverAgent

The RetrieverAgent is the top level component that manages the storage pipeline and exposes two method for search and retrieval of documents. The RetrieverAgent is broken
down into two main components, the 'retrieve' methods and an instance of a `DocumentManger`. The `DocumentManager` is responsible for managing the storage pipeline which will 
discuss in detail here.

### DocumentManager
The DocumentManager is broken down into to two main components, the loader and the document processor.

The loader is responsible for streaming data from the storage medium. To implement a loader, you need to implement the `Loader` interface. The `Loader` interface
has two methods that need to be implemented:

```python
class DocumentLoader(ABC, Specable[DocumentLoaderSpec]):
    logger = logging.getLogger("eidolon")

    @abstractmethod
    async def get_changes(self, metadata: Dict[str, Dict[str, Any]]) -> AsyncIterator[FileChange]:
        pass

    @abstractmethod
    async def list_files(self) -> AsyncIterator[str]:
        pass
```

The `get_changes` method is responsible for returning an async iterator of `FileChange` objects. The `FileChange` object is a simple data class that contains the path to the file
and the type of change that occurred. 

The `list_files` method is responsible for returning an async iterator of file paths.

There are currently a few loaders implemented in Eidolon, a simple FileSystemLoader and a GitHubLoader. The FileSystemLoader is used to load data from the local file system 
and the GitHubLoader is used to load data from a GitHub repository.

**We definitely need help implementing other loaders! Have a look at our GitHub repo on how to contribute to Eidolon**

The document processor is responsible for adding, removing, and replacing processed documents. The `DocumentProcessor` uses two configurable components, the `Parser` and the `Splitter`.

All implementations of the `DocumentParser` must implement the following interface:

```python
class DocumentParser(ABC, Specable[DocumentParserSpec]):
    @abstractmethod
    def parse(self, blob: DataBlob) -> Iterable[Document]:
        pass
```

The `parse` method is responsible for taking a `DataBlob` object and returning an iterable of `Document` objects. The `DataBlob` object is a simple data class that contains the path to the
file and methods to read the data. The `Document` object is a simple data class that contains the text data and metadata.

Parser implementations are responsible for parsing the given binary data and extracting text data from it. For example, the `PDFParser` is responsible for parsing PDF files into text data.
The `HTMLParser` is responsible for parsing HTML files, using BeautifulSoup, into text data, keeping semantic boundaries in mind.

All implementations of the `DocumentSplitter` must implement the following interface:

```python
class DocumentTransformer(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def transform_documents(self, documents: Iterable[Document], **kwargs: Any) -> Iterable[Document]:
        pass
```

The `transform_documents` method is responsible for taking an iterable of `Document` objects, splitting them on semantic boundaries, and returning an iterable of `Document` objects.
The main purpose of the splitter is to split large documents into smaller chunks that can be processed in parallel and to split documents on semantic boundaries. For example,
a splitter might split a word document by section boundaries, a code document by function boundaries, or an HTML document by paragraph boundaries.

Each of these components can be used in isolation or as part of a different pipeline. The `DocumentManager` is a simple built-in pipeline, but larger, more complex pipelines
are possible by assembling these components in different ways.

## Configuration of the RetrieverAgent
The `RetrieverAgent`, like every component in Eidolon, is configured using a YAML file. The configuration for the RAGAgent follows its specification, with a few twists that should make
it easier to configure.

There are two main sections of the configuration for the `RetrieverAgent`, the `document_manager` and the `retriever` information configured on the base class `RetrievalSpec` object.
In this section we will focus on the `document_manager` configuration. The next article will focus on the `retriever` configuration.

The `document_manager` configuration is defined by the following Spec:

```python
class DocumentManagerSpec(BaseModel):
    name: str
    recheck_frequency: int = Field(default=60, description="The number of seconds between checks.")
    loader: AnnotatedReference[DocumentLoader]
    doc_processor: AnnotatedReference[DocumentProcessor]
```

The `name` field is a string that is used to identify the `DocumentManager` in the logs. The `recheck_frequency` field is an integer that is used to determine how often the loader should check for changes, in seconds.
The `loader` field is a reference to the `Loader` implementation that should be used to load data. The `doc_processor` field is a reference to the `DocumentProcessor` implementation that should be used to process the data.

The loader and doc_processor fields are references to the implementations of the `Loader` and `DocumentProcessor` interfaces. The configuration of the loader is dependent on the 
implementation of the loader. An example configuration for the `FileSystemLoader` is included below.

The configuration of the `DocumentProcessor` is as follows:

```python
class DocumentProcessorSpec(BaseModel):
    parser: AnnotatedReference[DocumentParser]
    splitter: AnnotatedReference[DocumentTransformer]
```

The `parser` field is a reference to the `DocumentParser` implementation that should be used to parse the data. The `splitter` field is a reference to the `DocumentTransformer` 
implementation that should be used to split the data. Each of these are dependent on the implementation of the parser and splitter and usually don't require any additional configuration.

Here is an example configuration for a RetrieverAgent that searches the Eidolon GitHub repository for code, examples, and documentation:

```yaml
apiVersion: eidolon/v1
kind: Agent
metadata:
  name: repo_search

spec:
  implementation: RetrieverAgent
  name: "example_search"
  description: "Search the Eidolon github repository for code, examples, and documentation"
  document_manager:
    loader:
      implementation: GitHubLoader
      owner: "eidolon-ai"
      repo: "eidolon"
      pattern:
        - "examples/**/getting_started/**/*.yaml"
        - "examples/**/git_search/**/*.yaml"
        - "**/*.md"
        - "**/*.py"
      exclude: "**/test/**/*"
```

Of note here, we use the `GitHubLoader` to load data from the Eidolon GitHub repository including all markdown and python files, but excluding any files in the test directories. 

## Conclusion
In this post we discussed the storage pipeline in Eidolon, the components that make up the pipeline, and how to configure them. We also discussed the `DocumentManager` and how to configure it.

In the next post we will discuss the *retriever* part of the `RetrieverAgent` and how to configure it.
