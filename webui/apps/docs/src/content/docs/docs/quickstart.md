Welcome to the Eidolon Quickstart! This page covers a few prerequisites, cloning the Quickstart repository from GitHub, starting the agent machine, and conversing with your agent.

## Prerequisites

You don't need much to get started with Eidolon!

1. **OpenAI API Key**
The Quickstart connects to ChatGPT from OpenAI by default. Before continuing, obtain an API key from OpenAI and fund your account. Otherwise you will not be able to authenticate and will receive an error. <br><br>See [LLM Prerequisites](/docs/howto/authenticate_llm) for links to OpenAI and other popular LLM providers.

2. **Docker Engine**
The Quickstart uses Docker to run your agent machine. See <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/" target=_blank>Install Docker Engine</a> for installation instructions.

## Run Eidolon Quickstart

Running the Eidolon Quickstart requires only that you clone the repository to your machine and run a script.

1. Use git to clone the quickstart to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/eidolon-ai/eidolon-quickstart.git
```

2. Run the server in dev mode:

```bash
cd eidolon-quickstart
make docker-serve # or sudo make docker-serve
```

>üîé The first time you run this command, you will be prompted to enter the OpenAI API Key. Quickstart API keys and other credentials are stored in `eidolon-quickstart/.env`.

<br>If the server starts successfully, you should see output similar to this:

```text title=output

Get help from us on <a href="https://discord.com/invite/6kVQrHpeqG" target=_blank>Discord</a> üìû or submit an <a href="https://github.com/eidolon-ai/eidolon/issues/new/choose" target=_blank>issue on GitHub</a>. We want you to _love_ ‚ù§Ô∏è  working with Eidolon. If there's a problem, we want to fix it üõ†.

## Try it out!

Now that Eidolon is running, let's try it out! You can use the WebUI or command line interface (CLI) in a terminal.

### WebUI Developer Tool

A _Developer Tool_ web application is deployed to your server on port 3000. You can use the Developer Tool with any of your Eidolon applications.

To converse with your Eidolon agent for the first time...

1. Open a web browser to http://localhost:3000 (or replace localhost with your server URL).
2. Click the **Eidolon Developer Tool** app card.
3. Click **Execute** on your agent's "converse" action to begin a new conversation.
4. Say `hello!` to your agent in the text box.

Did your agent respond to you? üçæ Congratulations! You successfully created your first agent machine.

>üö® A common error is not having a funded account. If you have run into this error head over to <a href="https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/billing/overview" target=_blank>OpenAI Billing</a> to sort this out.

### Command Line Interface (CLI)

 If you prefer to use the CLI, open a new terminal window to interact with your agent.

1. Download the Eidolon CLI.
```bash
pip install 'eidolon-ai-client[cli]' -U
```

2. Create an AgentProcess.
```bash
export PID=$(eidolon-cli processes create --agent hello-world); echo $PID
```
>üî¨ _a process defines the boundaries of an agent's memory_

3. Converse with your agent.
```bash
eidolon-cli actions converse --process-id $PID --body "Hi! I made you"
```
## What's Happening?

The repository you  cloned:

- defines an **Agent Machine** üíª 
- with a single **Agent Program** ü§ñ 
- named `hello-world` üëã
- defined in a YAML file located at `resources/hello_world_agent.yaml`

The agent's YAML file describes:

- how to instantiate your agent from its **Agent Template** üè≠
- including the `system_prompt`, which are instructions to the LLM 
- and any customization you might want, such as [swapping out the LLM](/docs/howto/swap_llm), custom tools, etc.

```yaml title=resources/hello-world.yaml
apiVersion: server.eidolonai.com/v1alpha1
kind: Agent
metadata:
  name: hello-world

spec:
  description: "This is an example of a agent using the 'SimpleAgent' template."
  system_prompt: |
    You are a friendly ai agent who was just created by a brilliant developer getting started with Eidolon (great decision). You love emojis and use them liberally.
    Eidolon is an open source framework to build and deploy genAI services (like the one the user is currently interacting with).
    
    Congratulate them on completing the quickstart and recommend that they star the Eidolon [GitHub repoitory](https://eidolonai.com/) to show support and join the project's [discord](https://discord.com/invite/6kVQrHpeqG) for questions and feedback after your first message with them.
```

The `make docker-serve` command:
- downloads dependencies required to run the agent machine
- starts Eidolon in "dev-mode"

Dev mode provides a local http server and local memory, making it easy to focus on and get comfortable with Eidolon functionality.

## Have Fun! Change the System Prompt

To see how quickly you can iterate to build powerful agentic applications, make a simple change.

Using a text editor, change the system prompt:

```yaml title=resources/hello-world.yaml
  system_prompt: |
    Repeat the user prompt, then translate the user prompt into Spanish.
```
You do not need to restart. Simply return to the WebUI or CLI and say hello again. 

Try different user prompts (_messages_ you send to an agent in the WebUI or CLI) and system prompts (_instructions_ in the resource file to tell the agent what to do with user messages). Have fun!

## Next Steps
You can adapt this simple agent to do a lot of things! Try these things next.
